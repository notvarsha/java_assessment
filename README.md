# Java assessment

Please run the program using <code>cd encoder/ && javac EncoderDecoder.java && java EncoderDecoder</code>

The Object Oriented Principles (OOP) applied in this class are described as follows:

- Encapsulation: The encoding and decoding functionalities are encapsulated within the EncoderDecoder class, providing a clean interface for users to interact with.

- Abstraction: Users interact with the EncoderDecoder class without needing to understand the implementation details of encoding and decoding. They only need to call the appropriate methods with their inputs.

- Method: The encode and decode methods perform specific tasks, promoting code organization and reusability.

- Information Hiding: The implementation details, such as the reference table and offset calculation, are hidden within the class. Users need not be aware of these details when using the class.

- Encapsulation of State: The class does not maintain any state beyond the scope of individual method calls, which simplifies the design and usage of the class.
